# How to do ...?

This is a tutorial-like repository to remember how to do specific things in
software development or another kind of stuff.


<!--  -->
<!-- ## Software development -->
<!--  -->
<!--  -->
<!-- ### what to do on every project? -->
<!-- - **S1:** what's the problem(s) to solve? -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - **S2:** how I pretend to solve it?  <br> -->
<!--   Try to have a general idea of the solution (classes, methos, attributes), use graphics. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - **S3:** keep order in your code (use jupyter notebooks before pass your code to files) <br> -->
<!--    -->
<!--   - Create a jupyter-notebooks to start building the content of your code with the name of the future object -->
<!--    -->
<!--   - Start with functions and when you have a good stuff pass them to objects. Show valuable information to verify the correct behaviour. -->
<!--    -->
<!--   - Test your object in the jupyternotebook. Keep your code as simpler as possible. -->
<!--  -->
<!--    -->
<!-- - **S4:** Show your results (github, youtube, linkedin) -->
<!--   Add to github an explanation of what to do to use your code. Add graphics to make the reader understand what except to happend, and what's happening behind.  -->
<!--  -->
<!--  -->
<!-- ### add new feature to my repository? -->
<!-- - Create a repository with your code and requirements -->
<!-- - Add a new branch to your repository -->
<!-- - Add your feature -->
<!-- - Try to rerun your old features, and verify it doesn't crash -->
<!-- - Solve if it crashes -->
<!-- - Update your code and requirements -->
<!-- - Add you branch to your master -->
<!--  -->
